This is a personal webpage that is designed to be as helpful to [Sean](person.md) as possible.
The site should be a static site consisting of html and css.
To develop the site, I want to use a docker container for portability.
I want to use jekyll for configuration, but have never used it before.
I have a github.io page already set up and it is hosted on seanm603.com
